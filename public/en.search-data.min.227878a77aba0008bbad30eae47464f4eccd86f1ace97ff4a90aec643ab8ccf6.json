I think this better reflects the playstyle in Season 14.\nAs usual if you are high elo go make your own build.\nRunes\r#\rDematerializer\r#\rThis is an interesting alternative because farming is more difficult without Kraken (noonquiver) \u0026amp; Alacrity, which we had in previous seasons. We want to be able to:\n100-0 a ranged minion with aa \u0026gt; q in lane. This makes landing Q2 easier. One shot ranged minions with aa mid game Kill 2 melee minions with Q \u0026gt; AA \u0026gt; AA (procs love tap 2x on each minion) I think we need one stack each on ranged and melee minions, but I am not sure what is the best way to use the 3rd stack yet (probably ranged minion)\nSummoners\r#\rSome combination of Ghost, Flash, Exhaust. If they have skillshot CC (lux, ashe, blitz) then flash is necessary.\nCore\r#\ror If there are tanky threats, LDR 2nd item may be better Standard build\r#\rvs CC interrrupting ULT\r#\rvs AD Burst or hybrid damage.\r#\rGA can be used instead of shojin.\nvs AP Burst or enemy team is all AP.\r#\rThe problem with Maw is that it does not have lifesteal, which makes it hard to top off HP after getting poked. We used to solve this buy making BT for lifesteal and shield, but since BT has no shield now it is rather worthless into burst champions.\ndrain tank\r#\rUseful into champs who do not have the burst damage to kill us, \u0026ldquo;win-more\u0026rdquo; build\nIf you just want damage\r#\rBuilding like this just gets me killed though.\nExample Gameplay\r#\rShojin?\r#\rShojin looks like an oddball item, but MF can get stacks of shojin from:\n1 per second from E (total 2) 1 per second from First Strike (FS) (total 3) 1 per second from R (total 3) That means E + R + FS gives us 3 stacks of shojin for 1/3 of R\u0026rsquo;s duration, and the full 4 stacks for 2/3 of R duration. This still does not make shojin the best damage item, but Shojin is also a good source of HP.\nThe reason why we want HP, is that in this season, the assasins have so much lethality that buying armor does nothing unless we make 2 armor items.\nOpportunity and Hubris?\r#\rOn paper, Opportunity and hubris do more damage than collector, but from playtesting collector seems to feel better because it is \u0026ldquo;always-active\u0026rdquo;.\nHubris is a \u0026ldquo;win-more\u0026rdquo; item, its not very good if you cant get a kill every 90 seconds to maintain the uptime.\nCollector is more effective in teamfight situations, where your team contributes some damage to get enemies into the execute threshold. However this is not reflected in the computation, which assumes a 1v1 type scenario with the enemy champion at full health.\nFor these reasons I am revising the build suggestion, we will take a lower peak damage potential for better reliable damage potential.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/docs/paper-studies/lord-domniks-regards-vs-mortal-reminder/","title":"LDR vs MR","section":"Paper Studies","content":"\rLord Domnik\u0026rsquo;s Regards vs Mortal Reminder\r#\r"},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/mf-beginners-guide/","title":"MF Beginner's Guide","section":"Content","content":"\rGuide Introduction\r#\rI first played Miss Fortune in Season 2, and mained her more seriously after her 2016 rework. Miss Fortune plays and itemizes differently from other ADCs, and I hope this guide will help you enjoy Miss Fortune as much as I do. The guide is intended for new players who want learn how to play Miss Fortune better mechanically.\nWhy Play Miss Fortune?\r#\rPros\r#\rOne of the easiest ADC to CS with, because the Love Tap Passive means 1.25x - 1.5x ad damage to minions! Miss Fortune is a teamfighting monster, a well placed Bullet Time can win a game on its own Multiple playstyles due to huge build and rune diversity Strong late game dueling power, able to one shot any squishies in 0.45s with aa q aa Destroys towers very quickly High +95 movement speed due to strut Can build more AD items then other ADCs, while still hitting the 2.5 attack speed cap due to the free attack speed on strut Stronger user of lifesteal because her Passive, Q and W synergizes with lifesteal Cons\r#\rShort 550 auto attack range Base kit very weak into tanks. She must rely on accurate runes and item builds to circumvent this weakness Mana hungry. She cannot spam abilities without some mana regeneration in her build, and building mana means losing damage. No good escapes (dash/stun/root) A large part of her power buidget (Bullet Time) can be circumvented by basic abilities (wind wall) Weak early game dueling power because if she does not have the items to kill in under 4s, her W times out.

If you judge that Q cannot execute the minion (like in this clip) you can aa the minion to bring it into execute range first followed by Q. This combo is almost instantaneous, and needs abit of practice to get the timing right.\nAA \u0026gt; Q \u0026gt; AA is the second mechanic shown. It is Miss Fortune\u0026rsquo;s Bread and Butter combo, and is something that many inexperienced players mess up. They cast Q \u0026gt; AA and Miss Fortune loses allot of damage this way. If the Q bounces, The damage loss can be 210% ad + 180 damage (press the attack). Failing to execute this correctly can easily lose you a kill or teamfight.\nIn the example video, if I did not execute this combo correctly then Akali would have just walked away\naa + p \u0026gt; Q2 + p \u0026gt; aa \u0026gt; aa \u0026gt; aa \u0026hellip;\r#\rThe idea here is to proc our Love Tap (p) twice while maintaining DPS on a single champion. Sometimes, when there is a convenient minion we can cast Q on the minion (resetting Love Tap) and then landing Q2 with love tap on the enemy champion.\nStrut \u0026amp; Love Tap Reset Mechanics\r#\rAlternating auto attacks between 2 targets allows you to continuously proc Love Tap (Passive) and also have Strut permanantly activated, as Love Tap reduces the cooldown of strut. This also lets you destroy the nexus turrets very quickly\nFlash \u0026gt; aa \u0026gt; Q \u0026gt; aa\r#\rUsed to finish off fleeing enemies, This combo comes out almost instantly.\nMake sure your Q is off cooldown before flashing, notice I did not flash after lucian, as my Q was on cooldown. MF\u0026rsquo;s strongest point is when she has enough items to one-shot champions with AA \u0026gt; Q \u0026gt; QQ w \u0026gt; aa \u0026gt; Q \u0026gt; aa \u0026gt; aa \u0026gt; aa \u0026gt; \u0026hellip;\r#\rMiss Fortune\u0026rsquo;s Extended trade combo, it is weak early game, but gets strong after Strut is maxed and Miss Fortune has items like Kraken, Infinity Edge.\nE can be delayed until after any existing Crowd Control spells end. E \u0026gt; R\r#\rE slows enemies, so you can land more ticks of R\nMake sure you have enough (180) Mana to cast E + R! Otherwise just cast R. Flash -\u0026gt; E -\u0026gt; R\r#\rOften used in teamfights when their front line has engaged on you. Flash backwards to get away, and use R to melt down the enemy team\nStutter Stepping\r#\rStutter stepping is moving in between auto attacks, while still auto attacking at full speed. Is quite easy to execute early game, but is harder to pull off without losing dps as you attack speed increases.\nThere are several ways to pull this off.\nThe way I do it is to Attack move towards or on top of the enemy (a-click) then click to move away after the auto attack windup time is over. The second way is to re-bind the \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo; key to attack nearest enemy, then click away and press the \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo; key. This second way is easier to pull of mechanically, because you dont have to move the mouse at all\u0026hellip; Until the part where you have to cast a second Q. This is because you have to mentally switch from continuously clicking away to casting the Q and then switching back. Securing Assists\r#\rGetting assists is just free gold, and is sometimes needed to stack runes like eyeball collector. Make It Rain (E) is a perfect skill for getting free assists, and sometimes you can even use it to execute enemies with Collector!\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/docs/mf-item-build/archive/comet/","title":"Comet (13.09)","section":"Archive (Previous Patches)","content":"\rComet\r#\rTo me the comet playstyle is a saving grace type build when Miss Fortune is Counterpicked. We sacrifice duelling power for long ranged poke damage.\nOne recent game was when I locked in MF + Lux and was counterpicked by Draven. Comet got me out of laning phase with a small advantage, and this was enough to win the game as Draven falls off late game.\nIn general Comet tends to be better into immobile ADCs who cannot dash out of E range and the Comet proc.\nIn the late game, Comet will never be as good as PTA because we lose an entire 12% damage amplification on PTA, and Manaflow band is not a good trade for the 300 Overheal shield.\nRunes\r#\rI computed everything in the build assuming bloodline + cut down, but the runes are ultimately situational.\nAlacrity is better for killing as fast as possible, but early game it may delay Kraken by 900g if we need an early Scepter Attack speed shard over Adaptive Force is fine, but personally I like Q2 to do more damage early game. Coup de Grace over Cut Down is fine if there are no tanks Overheal + Bloodline is probably better into burst damage If there are no tanks, Eyeball Collector + Treasure Hunter kills faster mid game (full stacks), but it is obviously worse early game (0 stacks) and worse late game than alacrity + coup or alacrity + cut down. Overheal\r#\rOverheal is probably better than bloodline late game, as long as the build has some lifesteal in it. However, early game it delays our build by 900g because we have to build that Early Scepter. I was busy comparing bloodline to alacrity and forgot all about overheal\u0026hellip; If i ever re-do this page I would run overheal as default.\nJinx\r#\r2 Items tk ult AdHp ApHp adB apB g 2.2 2163 2989 2763 2893 2673 8350 2.2 2212 2985 2759 2893 2673 8300 2.5 2468 1099 2989 2893 2673 8150 While Yoummus kills slower, it is compensated by an earlier powerspike, more CDR and more ult damage.\n3rd Item: Mortal Reminder / LDR\n4 Items tk ult AdHp ApHp adB apB g 1.6 4618 4019 3579 3836 3416 13675 1.6 4869 4014 3574 3836 3416 13700 In a 1v1 duel, the Bloodthirster build should be the best since it has the highest AdHp / tk metric\n6 Items tk ult AdHp ApHp adB apB 0.54 6874 5693 4983 5023 4397 0.54 8335 4494 3934 4328 3788 Draven\r#\rThe difference between Draven and Jinx, is that Draven builds Shieldbow.

A rejection function is used to remove invalid combinations such as multiple mythics. Additional rules, such as requiring a grevious wounds item, can also be applied. To optimize the algorithm, AP items are removed for MF computation. Enemy build orders and runes are manually entered based on data from lolalytics or personal games.\nThe computation of damage is the complicated part of the algorithm and is done using an event queue. The queue checks which events (auto attacks, skills, items) are currently off cooldown and executes them, then moving the clock forward to the next event until a predetermined amount of time has passed. Tank champions require longer time intervals of 6-8 seconds compared to 4 seconds for other champions. This approach is called event-based simulation.\nAfter computing the damage and other statistics for every item combination, the results for damage, time to kill, and effective HP are stored. The challenge at this point is to make sense of the data since there is so much of it. One approach is to use multiple 2-variable Pareto curves to cull the data down, but there may be more efficient methods available.\nEngine Updates\r#\r13.8: Generating item printout is now threaded on a per-sort type basis instead of per-result basis 13.8: N item build now attempts references N-1 item build for item order search 13.8: Updated HP shard to 15-140 HP from 15-90\u0026hellip; cant believe I missed this one, seems OP 13.8: Started tracking the (effective_HP / tk) metric, which I think could give a better indication as to what build to go for against dps champions. That is, the faster that we can kill, the less defence we need to block incomming damage. This seems to favor bloodthirster late game. 13.7: For builds which costing less than the most expensive build, I previously added 1 ad per 35g under 6 items. Now, I instead add BFS / Pickaxe / LS item components, stopping when the build hits 6 components. This has the effect of giving value to slot efficency. 13.7: I no longer consider Collector\u0026rsquo;s execute damage when computing ult damage, as this somewhat skewed results favoring collector. 13.7: If a build does not have more lifesteal than dorans blade, the Vamp Scepter component is forced. This means Bloodline allows for Vamp Scepter to be skipped, which frees one slot 13.7: Lifeline and Stoneplate shields are now triggered at the 30% threshold, as opposed to a pre-process step. This theoretically should make BOTRK weaker, but it only affected item power levels into tanks 13.7: For the purposes of BOTRK, enemy healing is now applied linearly as the enemy takes damage. 13.6: Berzerkers Greaves is added to the item rotation instead of being a forced item. If no out-of-combat movement speed items (Yoummus, Zeal item, Lethality Mythics\u0026hellip;) are purchased, 300g boots1 are forced, consuming one slot. This is effectively a discount on movement speed items. 13.6: total distance traveled towards an enemy target in combat is computed. This includes temporary effects, such as BOTRK active "},{"id":9,"href":"/docs/mf-item-build/archive/pta-bloodline/","title":"PTA + Bloodline (13.09)","section":"Archive (Previous Patches)","content":"\rPTA Bloodline\r#\rMain advantage\r#\rBloodline gives us what I call \u0026ldquo;Build acceleration\u0026rdquo;. Into normal lanes, we can sustain well with bloodline + dorans, which allows us to quickly hit item powerspikes. With Alacrity, it is very common to have to sink 900g into Vamp Scepter. Late game, Bloodline is better into burst damage because of that extra 100 health. Bloodline tends to score well on the AdHp/Tk 1v1 metric Sample Gameplay\r#\rhttps://youtu.be/cNdXZ2Wsoi4 (with Maw) https://youtu.be/0SPfl7_N3Ls (with Collector) https://youtu.be/mT_FdifvPPk (with Maw) Supports\r#\rThe support makes or breaks botlane. This build must be played with a suitable supports.\nSuitable Supports:\r#\rHook Supports: Blitzcrank, Thresh, Nautilus, Pyke MF has trouble dashing into an engage far away. Hook supports solve this problem by bringing the fight to us.

You can use whatever Stat Mods you want (attack speed, adaptive force, armor, health). Scaling health is better late game rune, because into lethality stacking champions, the armor shard does nothing. Early game, the armor Stat Mod is better. adaptive force is better for poke (Q2) and ult damage. How to use the results below\r#\rIf Yoummus or some other out of combat movement speed item is not bought as a second item, then buy at least boots1. In playtesting I have been buying Yoummu\u0026rsquo;s second when I am ahead (better chase power and ult damage), but when behind it may be a bad idea The Berzerker\u0026rsquo;s Greaves upgrade is primarily for more movement speed. The damage can be good if we want the movement speed anyway, but if we dont want the movement speed then the damage is usually not good vs buying more AD. You can experiment with changing the build order You should choose the build based on your win condition (kill x champion, survive burst, \u0026hellip;) In general I figure out the strongest 6 item build, then work backwards to find the best build path Hybrid Builds\r#\rI find myself buying something like this very often, when there are hybrid threats. (BOTRK + LDR) is good into any tank matchup, Maw counters burst mages and BT is good into dps champions.\nUlt Damage\r#\rIf you want to transition late game into ult damage, then make this. It is the same into all matchups.

For more details consult the Simulation Data directly and create your own build.\nNote: nothing really changed between 14.13-14.16\nIdea\r#\rThe idea behind using PTA, is that\nThere are enemy team comps where MF gets jumped every teamfight and FS becomes useless. This means assasin comps\nSometimes, a successful ult is insufficient to clean up. This is the case against tanks.\nThe builds here are generated assuming we ult the enemy for its full duration, and then use autos to finish them off. The builds that can do this the fastest are considered the best. This is a departure from the previous idea of just using autos and ignoring ult damage.\nRunes\r#\rthis is better at L6+\nthis is better early game\nEarly Game\r#\rthis is extremely important against poke. If there is no poke you can skip scepter and the absorb life rune.\nIn general I will try to make cull over a long sword early game if I have 450g.\n14.16\rBlade of the Ruined King\nAttack Damage: 55 ⇒ 50 Attack Speed: 30% ⇒ 25% On-Hit Damage: 9% (melee) / 6% (ranged) ⇒ 10% (melee) / 6% (ranged) I cant believe they made it even worse. Its tremendously weaker than previous seasons. 14.15\rKraken Slayer\nMove Speed: 7% ⇒ 5% Bring it Down: 140-310 ⇒ 80% effectiveness for ranged champions (112-248) Wasnt good enough to build previously, and its even worse now. Lord Domniks Regards\nArmor Penetration: 40% ⇒ 35% This is pretty painful, but LDR/MR is still the most powerful item in the game for MF. Mortal Reminder\nAttack Damage: 40 ⇒ 35 Grevious wounds is much more powerful than LDR\u0026rsquo;s +10ad against almost any kind of healing. Berserker’s Greaves\nAttack Speed: 35% ⇒ 30% Even less reason to build it now. Wit’s End\nFray: 15-80 ⇒ 40-80 We dont really build this now, but it was situationally good in previous seasons. Dark Harvest\nCooldown: 40 ⇒ 35 On-takedown reset timer: 1.5s ⇒ 1s Probably doesnt matter. DH cant proc multiple times per ult, and without the stealth passive on Duskblade Mythic the DH playstyle is dead Fleet Footwork\nHeal: 8-110 (linear) (+10% Bonus AD) (+5% AP) ⇒ 5-120 (following stat progression multiplier) (+10% Bonus AD) (+5% AP) Not relevant for MF. Death’s Dance\nArmor: 40 ⇒ 50 I dont think this makes it good enough to buy. Stacking HP/Shields (Shieldbow) is more effective because with only 1 armor item, lethality stacking assasins still reduce our armor value to 0 14.14\rAbsorb Life\nHealing: 2-20 (linear scaling) ⇒ 1-23 (following base stat progression) ( Note: This is a nerf levels 1-12 and a buff levels 13-18.) This is a nerf. Late game we can heal fine with BT, we only benefit from this rune before making the scepter component. 14.13\rMF got a buff,\nyou can absolutely feel its easier to last hit under tower thanks to the +3 base AD. The \u0026ldquo;Strut Damage Lock-out\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;initial bonus\u0026rdquo; move speed buff is nice but its difficult to gauge how much of an impact this has, because we can W active to get the full max move speed immediately. The +5 to max bonus move speed is actually noticable, its possible to chase down champs more easily now. overall we can last hit slightly easier with the +3 AD, and we can chase better because the initial bonus move speed was substantially increased.\nMiss Fortune\nBase Attack Damage: 52 ⇒ 55 Strut Damage Lock-out: 5 seconds ⇒ 4 seconds Strut Upgraded Move speed delay: 5 seconds ⇒ 3 seconds Strut Max bonus move speed: 55/65/75/85/95 ⇒ 60/70/80/90/100 Strut Initial Bonus move speed: 25 ⇒ 30/35/40/45/50 Dark Harvest\nDamage: 20-80 (+5 per Soul) ⇒ 20 (+9 per Soul) (bonus ratios unchanged) Cooldown: 45 ⇒ 40 Electrocute\nDamage: 30-220 ⇒ 50-190 (bonus ratios unchanged) Cooldown: 25-20 (based on level) ⇒ 20 14.11\rThe main change is that IE got severely nerfed to the point its no longer a good early game rush item\u0026hellip; and Shieldbow got an enormous buff.\nLooking at the AA only dataset, ER / Axiom kills draven the fastest at 1 item, but these items not what we want mid game\u0026hellip;. For this reason playing for autos early game seems to be dead because we dont have a strong 1st and 2nd item to support it. We really need to play for ult damage and short trades (aa q aa \u0026amp; q2) instead Default Build\rBuild Idea\r#\rThe build idea here is to optimize for 2 parameters:\nIf someone jumps on us, we want to blow them up in the least possible time I also want good ult damage, so even if rageblade/kraken/BOTRK does kill someone faster in an all-in, I avoid them because they greatly impact ult damage. Early game we want to take trades with aa\u0026gt;q\u0026gt;aa or Q2 and back off to heal back using lifesteal. Late game, we wait for our team to CC and then press R to get a couple of kills.\nCore Items\r#\rNote that following the build exactly is difficult because of high item component costs. We may have bought some longswords before getting the BFS needed for BT for instance. Collector can be built before IE to absorb some longswords too.\nAnti AP Assassins\rReplace Yun Tal with Maw If this is not enough, replace collector with mercurial Anti AD \u0026amp; Hybrid damage Assassins\rReplace Yun Tals with Shieldbow?

Even without the PTA rune, aa \u0026gt; q \u0026gt; aa is faster than q \u0026gt; aa \u0026gt; aa\u0026hellip; So there is really no reason not to aa first. Overheal\r#\rThis 300 HP shield is worth 2 ruby crystals, or 800g. It also helps you to kill the first enemy champion, and increases MF\u0026rsquo;s effective HP by 12.5%.\nShields in general are good on MF, because strut\u0026rsquo;s movement speed bonus is retained as long as the shield does not break.\nCompared to Triumph, Overheal helps you kill the first enemy champion while triumph may give you a better chance to kill the 3rd enemy champion and beyond, since it heals at most 7.5% HP per kill.\nI prefer Overheal because I think securing the first 2 kills is more important than a better chance of a third kill\nBloodline\r#\rI currently favor Bloodline over Alacrity, and there are several reasons\nSlot Efficiency: MF is the kind of champion who really wants early game lifesteal. This means that in an alacrity build, MF potentially has in inventory: (Dorans, Cull, Refillable, Scepter, Pickaxe, Noonquiver). This means that we may not have a slot to build Cloak without selling Refillable, and thats at 1 item! With bloodline, I can often keep Dorans Blade until buying the 6th item, which is really getting maximum value out of Dorans. Note that Dorans and Bloodline together is more lifesteal than Scepter or Shieldbow. Build Acceleration: With Bloodline, it is easier to build Kraken Slayer immediately without being forced to buying Scepter early to avoid getting forced out of lane. Kraken 900g earlier is a big deal Into strong poke we can buy scepter anyway and have 14.75% lifesteal, which makes it much easier to survive lane. Alacrity\r#\rAlacrity is better when the plan is to itemize Bloodthirster or BOTRK 2nd item. This is because too much lifesteal is not a good thing early game. After our HP is topped off, lifesteal loses much of its value\nCoup de Grace\r#\rCoup de Grace is better if the enemy champion has under 250 more HP than MF. A Mythic like shieldbow is sufficient to make Cut Down better late game. In general Miss Fortune can one shot squishies even without this rune, but she struggles against tanks and needs all the help she can get.\nCut Down\r#\rMassive 5-15% steroid into any champion with than 10% (250) more HP than Miss Fortune.\nAbsolute Focus\r#\rFree AD\nGathering Storm\r#\rMassive amount of AD late game, almost worth an entire item\nManaflow Band\r#\rBest rune for more mana, get this over Absolute Focus if mana is a problem\nDark Harvest\r#\rIf the entire enemy team is low, then we can proc Dark Harvest 5x for pretty good damage. Dark Harvest is unfortunately bad into tanks, because we cannot take Dark Harvest, Cut Down and Gathering Storm together. If we cant kill the tank, we cant get our Dark Harvest reset either.\nElectrocute\r#\rElectrocute is worse than Press the Attack for several reasons\nThe cooldown on Electrocute is much longer (20s vs 6s) A 12% self and allied damage multipler trumps the .4 bonus AD ratio if it takes more than aa \u0026gt; q \u0026gt; aa to kill that champion. The biggest problem is that the minor runes , because a 12% damage multiplier for 6s trumps a .4 AD ratio. The bigger problem is that the domination minor runes are worse\n"},{"id":15,"href":"/docs/mf-beginners-guide/summoner-spells/","title":"Summoner Spells","section":"MF Beginner's Guide","content":"\rSummoner Spells\r#\rExhaust\r#\rI strongly reccomend Exhaust as the go-to summoner spell for Miss Fortune in soloq, as Exhaust gives you the best chance of winning 1v1 fights. Miss Fortune can have 2716 Health + Shield from Bloodthirster and Overheal. With Exhaust active, an assasin would have to deal 4526 damage to kill you, effectively giving you potentially 1800 extra HP in a 1v1 situation.\nThe example video shows you how to use exhaust. I would probably have died here if Brand\u0026rsquo;s damage was not reduced by 40% by Exhaust.\nHere is another example of a late game 6 item 1v1 fight, where Exhaust let me easily beat a 6 item lucian.

If your support naturally builds healing amplification items, it may be better for the support to take Heal instead of MF.\nCleanse\r#\rTo some extent, Cleanse is a soft counter to Exhaust because it removes the effect of Exhaust.\nCleanse can be strong into champions with strong Crowd Control. One good example is Ashe, if we get stunned by Ashe ultimate, we will likely die without cleanse even if we exhaust Ashe.\nBarrier\r#\rThis is just a stronger single target version of Heal.\n"},{"id":16,"href":"/posts/13_10_pbe/","title":"13 10 Pbe","section":"Posts","content":"\rJinx\r#\rInto Jinx, the fastest killing build is Navori at item 1, but Navori is not good at item 2.

The scaling of Maw\u0026rsquo;s shield with bonus AD is noteworthy, and since MF accumulates a significant amount of this stat, it adds to the item\u0026rsquo;s usefulness.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to keep in mind that to maximize the value of Maw, a substantial amount of bonus AD is required. Therefore, opting to build Hexdrinker in the early game (even as early as the second item) and postponing the purchase of Maw until the fifth or sixth item is often a more effective strategy.\nIn the video clip, I would not have survived the incomming AP damage without the magic resistance and shield from Maw.\nWit\u0026rsquo;s End\r#\rWit\u0026rsquo;s End is better thought of as primarily a damage item with some Magic Resistance attached to it. Wits is often competitive or stronger in damage to BOTRK into squishy champions\nOne problem with buying Wit\u0026rsquo;s End as the first defensive item against Magic Damage, is that the defensive effect is often completely negated by Magic Penetration items when Miss Fortune completes Wits.\nInto champions who do not itemize magic resistance, such as tanks, Wit\u0026rsquo;s End can be a decent defensive pick which does not sacrifice too much damage. It is decent into magic damage tanks who build Thornmail.\nAs a second Magic Resistance item after Maw, we will get full value from the Magic Penetration as seen in the computations below.\nMiss Fortune Magic Resistance\r#\rItem Magic Resistance Cumalative Base 52.1 52.1 Maw 50 102.1 Wit\u0026rsquo;s End 40 142.1 Expected Maximum Enemy Mpen with Mpen mythic\r#\rItem MPEN %MPEN Luden\u0026rsquo;s Tempest 26 0 Sorcerer\u0026rsquo;s Shoes 18 0 Shadowflame 20 0 Zhonya\u0026rsquo;s Hourglass 0 0 Deathcap 0 0 Void Staff 0 40% Total 64 40% Therefore anything under 64 / 0.6 = 106.67 Magic Resistance will get reduced to 0.\nNote that enemy Magic penetration can be even higher than this with Morellonomicon, but if the enemy champion drops Hourglass, Void Staff or Deathcap, its a good thing for Miss Fortune.\nHourglass is a great counter for Bullet Time Losing Death Cap is generally a bigger damage loss than the +10 mpen from Morellonomicon Void staff\u0026rsquo;s 40% magic pen is worth much far more than +10 magic pen from Morellonomicon Mercurial Scimitar \u0026amp; Silvermere Dawn\r#\rAs a first magic resistance item, they suffer the same problem as Wit\u0026rsquo;s End of the magic resistance potentially being completely ineffective defensively.\nI do not like the fairly weak stats on these items either. unlike Wit\u0026rsquo;s End, significant damage is lost buying either of these items. They should be bought primarily as a counter to supression effects (Warwick, Malzahar, Skarner) if we judge that countering the suppression in this way is sufficent to win teamfights.\nOften, the correct response is instead to hide in a brush until a teamfight starts, then countering the suppression champions with ultimate.\nOne champion I am not entirely sure about is Mordekaiser. Usually building dps (PTA, Cut Down, Kraken, LDR, BOTRK, Wit\u0026rsquo;s End) allows us to kill Mordekaiser in his ultimate, making QSS unnecessary. However if Mordekaiser uses Anathema\u0026rsquo;s Chains, I dont know if Miss Fortune can still beat Mordekaiser in his ult at full build.\nEdge of Night\r#\rIf there is an enemy player who can consistently stop our ultimate, this is a fairly good pickup\nGuardian Angel\r#\rConceptually this is just the AD version of Maw, but annoyingly the 5min cooldown is extremely long.

Treasure Hunter\u0026rsquo;s gold can be converted into 12.8 ad, while using eyeball collector instead gives us 18 ad.\nI dislike gold generating runes because at full build, gold generating runes have no value since we cannot convert the extra gold into stats. It is therefore better to take stat runes if the two options are equal in value\nI do think ultimate hunter is pretty interesting. My computer simulations have difficulty evaluating the value of \u0026ldquo;utility\u0026rdquo;. From playtesting, with ultimate hunter and axiom we can spam ult at a very high frequency. This is important because with comet runes our damage with autos is much weaker than with PTA.\nItems\r#\rHis build seems to be:\nTear start Duskblade, Berzerkers, Manamune, Edge of Night, Axiom, Serylda\u0026rsquo;s Grudge, Zhonyas (!!) He may build Edge of Night first (!) depending on matchup. After trying to improve this with computer simulations, I came up with this:\nFairy Charm start (greedier than Tear, works the same for me) Duskblade, Boots1, Axiom, Bloodthirster, Last Whisper Item, Edge of Night Sell Boots1 for Collector or Zhonyas Edge of Night built first into CC Prefer LDR into tanks and Mortal into healing, otherwise Serylda\u0026rsquo;s The idea is to respect 당신의 아이돌\u0026rsquo;s playstyle, but improve the build for lower elo games.\nChanged: Rune setup with Treasure hunter changed to Eyeball Collector.
