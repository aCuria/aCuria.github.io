	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>I am aCuria, a Miss Fortune Main. I first played Miss Fortune in Season 2, and mained her more seriously after her 2016 rework. Miss Fortune plays and itemizes differently from other ADCs, and I hope this guide will help you enjoy Miss Fortune as much as I do. This guide is intended for players who want learn how to play Miss Fortune better from a mechanics and decision making perspective. For item and rune builds, you can find my builds here: <a href="builds.html">MF Builds</a>.</p>

	<h1>Why Play Miss Fortune?</h1>
	<p>
		<h2>Pros: </h2>
		<ul>
			<li>One of the easiest ADC to CS with, because the Love Tap Passive means 1.25x - 1.5x damage to minions!</li>
			<li>Teamfighting Monster, Bullet Time can turn a loss into a win</li>
			<li>Multiple playstyles due to huge build and rune diversity</li>
			<li>Late game one shots any squishy in 0.5s with aa q aa</li>
			<li>Destroys towers very quickly</li>
			<li>High +95 movement speed due to strut</li>
			<li>Can build more AD items then other ADCs, while still hitting the 2.5 attack speed cap due to the free attack speed on strut</li>
			<li>Higher potential lifesteal than other ADCs because her Q+W synergizes with lifesteal</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Cons: </h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Short 550 auto attack range</li>
			<li>Base kit very weak into tanks. She must rely on accurate runes and item builds to circumvent this weakness</li>
			<li>Mana hungry. She cannot spam abilities without some mana regeneration in her build</li>
			<li>No escapes (dash/stun/root)</li>
			<li>Main power (Bullet Time) can be circumvented by certain abilities (wind wall)</li>
			<li>Weak early game 1v1 because if she does not have the items to kill in under 4s, her W times out.</li>
		</ul>
