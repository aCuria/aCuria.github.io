# Introduction
In 14.8 I changed how tkill is computed. Previously I only considered aa damage, but I think MF's play pattern has changed. Now it is very important to cast R first, and then follow up with autos later.

The kill time should then be computed by computing R damage first, and then moving on to autos only if the enemy is not dead yet.

I also want to hard-code yoummus and collector as the first 2 items, because although collector is less stat efficient after the nerf, MF's play pattern means that collector has the most efficient passive.
