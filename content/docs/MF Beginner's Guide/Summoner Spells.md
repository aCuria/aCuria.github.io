# Summoner Spells

## Exhaust
I strongly reccomend Exhaust as the go-to summoner spell for Miss Fortune in soloq, as Exhaust gives you the best chance of winning 1v1 fights. Miss Fortune can have 2716 Health + Shield from Bloodthirster and Overheal. With Exhaust active, an assasin would have to deal 4526 damage to kill you, effectively giving you potentially 1800 extra HP in a 1v1 situation.

The example video shows you how to use exhaust. I would probably have died here if Brand's damage was not reduced by 40% by Exhaust.

Here is another example of a late game 6 item 1v1 fight, where Exhaust let me easily beat a 6 item lucian. Having exhaust also allowed me to itemize Maw against the Fiddlesticks and Maokai threats, knowing that Exhaust will let me beat Vayne and Lucian 1v1.

An example of a perfectly timed exhaust letting me 1v1 a katarina, facetanking through her ultimate.

To some extent, Exhaust beats Heal because it reduces more damage.


## Flash
If the enemy has dangerous skillshots which can be dodged using Flash, then Flash should be a priority pick. 

For example, flash is good into Hook Supports, Ashe, Lux, Morgana, Swain and so on.

## Ghost
Ghost should be picked whenever Flash is not necessary. It gives Miss Fortune strong chase potential 


## Heal
To some extent, Heal is a counter to Cleanse because you cannot Cleanse Heal. However, the effect of Heal is very small, and likely insufficient to save you against an Assasin.

Heal can be better if the enemy team (Lux, Xerath) can kill you from outside of Exhaust's cast range. If your support naturally builds healing amplification items, it may be better for the support to take Heal instead of MF. 


## Cleanse

To some extent, Cleanse is a soft counter to Exhaust because it removes the effect of Exhaust.

Cleanse can be strong into champions with strong Crowd Control. One good example is Ashe, if we get stunned by Ashe ultimate, we will likely die without cleanse even if we exhaust Ashe.


## Barrier
This is just a stronger single target version of Heal.
