# Ult Build (Patch 14.8)
This build has been reworked for patch 14.8

Instead of only looking at ult damage, we look at 100-0 kill times instead.

However, instead of looking at kill times starting with W > AA > Q > AA > AA, The combo used is E > R > W > AA > Q > AA > AA > ...

That is, Ult is cast first. I think this better reflects the playstyle in Season 14.

As usual if you are high elo go make your own build.

Dematerializer is an interesting alternative. This rune allows us to more easily kill a full health minion with aa > q, for Q2 crits. It also lets us one shot the ranged minions earlier in the game.

## Summoners
Some combination of Ghost, Flash, Exhaust. If they have skillshot CC (lux, ashe, blitz) then flash is necessary.

- If there are tanky threats, LDR 2nd item may be better

The problem with Maw is that it does not have lifesteal, which makes it hard to top off HP after getting poked. We used to solve this buy making BT for lifesteal and shield, but since BT has no shield now it is rather worthless into burst champions.

Useful into champs who do not have the burst damage to kill us, "win-more" build

Building like this just gets me killed though.


## Example Gameplay

{{< youtube vUS12Rgv_lw >}}


## Shojin?

Shojin looks like an oddball item, but MF can get stacks of shojin from:
- 1 per second from E (total 2)
- 1 per second from First Strike (FS) (total 3)
- 1 per second from R (total 3)

That means E + R + FS gives us 3 stacks of shojin for 1/3 of R's duration, and the full 4 stacks for 2/3 of R duration. This still does not make shojin the best damage item, but Shojin is also a good source of HP. 

The reason why we want HP, is that in this season, the assasins have so much lethality that buying armor does nothing unless we make 2 armor items. 

## Opportunity and Hubris?

![](/item/6701.png)

On paper, Opportunity and hubris do more damage than collector, but from playtesting collector seems to feel better because it is "always-active". 

Hubris is a "win-more" item, its not very good if you cant get a kill every 90 seconds to maintain the uptime. 

Collector is more effective in teamfight situations, where your team contributes some damage to get enemies into the execute threshold. However this is not reflected in the computation, which assumes a 1v1 type scenario with the enemy champion at full health.

For these reasons I am revising the build suggestion, we will take a lower peak damage potential for better reliable damage potential.
