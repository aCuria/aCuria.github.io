# This entire page is work in progress due to the massive changes in 13.10.

## 



















# PTA Bloodline

## Main advantage 
- Bloodline gives us what I call "Build acceleration". Into normal lanes, we can sustain well with bloodline + dorans, which allows us to quickly hit item powerspikes. With Alacrity, it is very common to have to sink 900g into Vamp Scepter.
- Late game, Bloodline is better into burst damage because of that extra 100 health.
- Bloodline tends to score well on the AdHp/Tk 1v1 metric 

## Sample Gameplay


## Supports
The support makes or breaks botlane. This build **must** be played with a suitable supports.

### Suitable Supports:
- Hook Supports: Blitzcrank, Thresh, Nautilus, Pyke
	- MF has trouble dashing into an engage far away. Hook supports solve this problem by bringing the fight to us. 
- Poke + Engage Supports: Ashe, Lux
	- long stuns / roots that go through minions
- AOE Engage Supports: Ammumu, Neeko, Galio, Rell
	- Survive lane and get 5 man ults

### Unsuitable Supports: use comet or different adc.
- No on demand engage:
	- Soraka, Brand, Veigar,
- Engages too far away
	- Yuumi, Senna,

I computed everything in the build assuming these runes.
- Use Manaflow Band over AbsoluteFocus if you can't conserve mana use
- Use Coup de Grace if there are no enemies with more than 10% more HP than you.
- You can use whatever Stat Mods you want (attack speed, adaptive force, armor, health). 
	- Scaling health is better late game rune, because into lethality stacking champions, the armor shard does nothing. Early game, the armor Stat Mod is better.
	- adaptive force is better for poke (Q2) and ult damage.

## How to use the results below
- I force either boots1 or a movement speed item to be bought. 
- Builds with a movement speed item have an extra 300g to spend on ad components 
- Note that I currently assume that Yoummu's extra lethality is only active for the entirety of ult and then first 0.1s of combat.

## Glossary 

- Build: Items purchased
- g: Build cost in gold 
- tk: Time taken to kill in seconds
- ult: Bullet Time damage
- aaqaa: Damage dealt by aa q aa into a full HP enemy
- AdHp: Effective HP against AD damage, considers self healing and enemy armor pen
- ApHp: Effective HP against AP damage, considers self healing and enemy magic pen
- adB: Effective HP against AD burst damage, considers enemy armor pen
- apB: Effective HP against AP burst damage, considers enemy magic pen



# Item 1
- The Item 1 builds were computed against Jinx's (the adc's) stats 
- Galeforce is mainly good when the active is off cooldown, and you hit someone under 25% HP for bonus damage



# Full Builds

I have no idea whats best for 13.10 yet, but here is some data



## Jinx

I use Jinx's stats to represent all the ADCs who are not building shieldbow

This specific build hits some breakpoint and kills Jinx with just aa > q 


### Sorted by increasing ult damage 


### Sorted by increasing AdHp/Tk


### Builds that enable aa > q = Kill breakpoint 



## Zac (Anti Tank) 


### Ult Damage Build?



## Draven

I use Draven's stats to represent all the ADCs who build shieldbow

note: **dorans shield = statikk shiv** until riot updates their api and i pull the new images






## Aurelion Sol 

DPS Mage 


## Vex
I use Vex's stats to represent all the Burst Mages. (Not Kayle, Cass who are sustained damage mages)



## Rengar
I use Rengar's stats to represent all the AD Burst assasins. (Not Nocturne / Yi who will auto attack forever)

I forced the algo to use GA, no idea why nashors sometimes pops up, you have to figure out the order to build the items yourself.




## Riven 

Fastest Kill Time Build 


## Sylas


## Zac
1v1 Build (Best AdHp/Tk) 


## Chogath

## Ksante (Tank Form)
1v1 Build (Best AdHp/Tk) 

## Sion



## Vayne with Randuin's Omen 
Randuins Omen Vayne gets his own section because he can be annoying. I **think** making high AdHp/Tk does not work into vayne's true damage, so my guess is that fastest kill time is best.



## Mordekaiser using Anathema's Chains
1v1 Build (Best AdHp/Tk)
