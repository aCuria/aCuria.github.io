# PTA Guide (Updated Patch 14.11)
I am going to keep it simple. For more details consult the Simulation Data directly and create your own build.

# Idea
The idea behind using PTA, is that 

- There are enemy team comps where MF gets jumped every teamfight and FS becomes useless. This means assasin comps

- Sometimes, a successful ult is insufficient to clean up. This is the case against tanks.

The builds here are generated assuming we ult the enemy for its full duration, and then use autos to finish them off. The builds that can do this the fastest are considered the best. This is a departure from the previous idea of just using autos and ignoring ult damage.

## Early Game

![](/item/1053.png) this is extremely important against poke. If there is no poke you can skip scepter and the absorb life rune.

MF got a buff, 
- you can absolutely feel its easier to last hit under tower thanks to the +3 base AD. 
- The "Strut Damage Lock-out" and "initial bonus" move speed buff is nice but its difficult to gauge how much of an impact this has, because we can W active to get the full max move speed immediately.
- The +5 to max bonus move speed is actually noticable, its possible to chase down champs more easily now.

overall we can last hit slightly easier with the +3 AD, and we can chase better because the initial bonus move speed was substantially increased.

Miss Fortune
- Base Attack Damage: 52 ⇒ 55
- Strut Damage Lock-out: 5 seconds ⇒ 4 seconds
- Strut Upgraded Move speed delay: 5 seconds ⇒ 3 seconds
- Strut Max bonus move speed: 55/65/75/85/95 ⇒ 60/70/80/90/100
- Strut Initial Bonus move speed: 25 ⇒ 30/35/40/45/50

Dark Harvest
- Damage: 20-80 (+5 per Soul) ⇒ 20 (+9 per Soul) (bonus ratios unchanged)
- Cooldown: 45 ⇒ 40

Electrocute
- Damage: 30-220 ⇒ 50-190 (bonus ratios unchanged)
- Cooldown: 25-20 (based on level) ⇒ 20

The main change is that IE got severely nerfed to the point its no longer a good early game rush item... and Shieldbow got an enormous buff.
- Looking at the AA only dataset, ER / Axiom kills draven the fastest at 1 item, but these items not what we want mid game....  
- For this reason playing for autos early game seems to be dead because we dont have a strong 1st and 2nd item to support it. We really need to play for ult damage and short trades (aa q aa & q2) instead

# Build Idea 
The build idea here is to optimize for 2 parameters:
- If someone jumps on us, we want to blow them up in the least possible time
- I also want good ult damage, so even if rageblade/kraken/BOTRK does kill someone faster in an all-in, I avoid them because they greatly impact ult damage.

Early game we want to take trades with aa>q>aa or Q2 and back off to heal back using lifesteal. Late game, we wait for our team to CC and then press R to get a couple of kills.

## Core Items

![](/item/3142.png)


Note that following the build exactly is difficult because of high item component costs. We may have bought some longswords before getting the BFS needed for BT for instance. Collector can be built before IE to absorb some longswords too.

{{< tab "Anti AP Assassins" >}}
- Replace Yun Tal with Maw
- If this is not enough, replace collector with mercurial

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Anti AD & Hybrid damage Assassins" >}}

- Replace Yun Tals with Shieldbow? (~4000 -> ~6000 ehp)
- Replace IE with EoN or Bloodmail? (~6000 -> ~7000 ehp)

# Support Champions
The support makes or breaks botlane. This build **must** be played with a suitable supports.

## Suitable Supports:
- Hook Supports: Blitzcrank, Thresh, Nautilus, Pyke
	- MF has trouble dashing into an engage far away. Hook supports solve this problem by bringing the fight to us. 
- Poke + Engage Supports: Ashe, Lux
	- long stuns / roots that go through minions. The CC sets up MF's ultimate. 
- AOE Engage Supports: Ammumu, Neeko, Galio, Rell
	- Survive lane and get 5 man ults

## Unsuitable Supports: use comet or different adc.
- No on demand engage:
	- Soraka, Brand, Veigar,
- MF cannot take advantage of these "delayed CC" champions well.
	- Yuumi, Senna, Karma
