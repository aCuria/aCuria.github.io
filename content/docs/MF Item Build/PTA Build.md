# PTA Guide (Updated Patch 13.16)
I am going to keep it simple. For more details consult the Simulation Data directly and create your own build.

# Duskblade Build

## Core Items

![](/item/7002.png)![](/item/3153.png)![](/item/3036.png)

This is the core build I try to go for. It does well at 1 item (Best for Ult), decently at 2 items but it really spikes hard at 3 items. 

Duskblade can be replaced with Yoummus, but I prefer Duskblade. In the early game, duskblade has higher kill times AND ult damage. In the late game, Yoummus has better ult damage (only when bonus lethality is active) while Duskblade has faster kill times because the bonus lethality is gone after you ult.

You may need mortal reminder instead of LDR. consult the LDR vs MR page to find out when to buy what.

## AD Assasins

Unfortunately, our capability to tank through AD assassin damage has been severely gimped because of nerfs to Overheal (less shield), Bloodthirster (No Shield) and Shieldbow (Not Mythic). For this reason, we have to lean into GA which makes us a less tempting target.

I think Shieldbow is not very helpful into the assasins, but this is based on my own playtesting rather than computation so do your own testing. The bloodline, shieldbow and health Stat Mod ideas felt weak when i tried them.

## AP Burst Champions
![](/item/7002.png)![](/item/3153.png)![](/item/3036.png)![](/item/3156.png)![](/item/3091.png)![](/item/6672.png)

We have always leaned into Maw against AP burst. Since Maw now scales with AD, its not so good when used with low ad builds.

Stacking Wits with Maw can be helpful because some Champions can reduce our MR to zero even with Maw. Therefore building even more MR is helpful.

## Ultimate Damage
![](/item/7002.png)![](/item/3036.png)![](/item/3072.png)![](/item/6676.png)![](/item/6672.png)![](/item/6696.png) Almost full ult damage

![](/item/7002.png)![](/item/3036.png)![](/item/3072.png)![](/item/6676.png)![](/item/6696.png)![](/item/6693.png) Full ult damage

I think that going all out maximizing ult damage alone is usually bad, a hybrid build with good ult and Sustained damage is probably better most of the time.

This "hybrid build" can be achieved by building Kraken 5th.

## Sustained Damage / DPS
![](/item/7002.png)![](/item/3153.png)![](/item/3036.png)![](/item/6676.png)![](/item/6672.png)![](/item/3091.png)

Damage is similar between Wits and Shiv, but Wits has more defensive power.

![](/item/3091.png)![](/item/3087.png)

For dps Champions, maximizing time to kill against effective HP against sustained damage is usually the correct choice. 

For bruisers we need to kill them in the small window where they are CCed by our team. This means maximizing dps in a full glass cannon build.

Into tanks, we just want as much DPS as possible, as well as sufficient defenses to survive their damage. Kraken is particularly good into targets that take > 3 hits to kill, otherwise Kraken passive is wasted.

Wits End is good into thornmail, since thornmail users do not buy enough mpen to counter wits end and base resistances.












# Deeper dive into the build 
I used data from Simulation Data/All to settle on duskblade as the mythic of choice. This item does well on the TK_ULT pareto curve into non-tanks, yet it is one of the best mythics into tanks (outside of Rageblade, which has poor ult damage and build path)

Playtesting has also supported the idea that duskblade is probably the best mythic for MF the majority of the time 

## 1st item
At 1 item, we want to be able to duel the enemy ADC in a laning phase situation. Looking at the Duskblade/Jinx data, we can see that the 3 candidate items are 

- Kraken (strongest all-in)
- Ravenous Hydra (Middle Ground)
- Duskblade (strongest Ult) 

If we look at the 2 to 6 item data, we can see that Ravenous Hydra falls off the pareto curve later in the game. For this reason we can strike Hydra off.

Kraken unfortunately has an absolutely abysmal build path for MF, because it now builds out of recurve bow instead of Pickaxe.

Therefore, since we are going for a duskblade build anyway, Duskblade seems to be the best choice for our first item.

## 2nd Item 
The problem with the second item is that we are potentially sitting on a fair number of items:
1) Duskblade
2) Boots1
3) Scepter 
4) Dorans 
5) Cull (With Stacks)
6) Refillable

Of these items, we only want to sell Refillable and cull (when completed). This means an item like Collector is difficult to build because it has 3 components and we will be floating significant gold saving for it.

If we look at the 3 item ASol / graves / Jax data, we can see that the Duskblade - BOTRK - Last Whisper idea is strong. It is also cheaper to build BOTRK because we are already sitting on one component (Scepter) so the 2 item powerspike will be hit earlier than with other choices

Alternate 2nd items:
- Axiom Arc / Collector (vs ADCs or other champions who buy neither HP nor Armor items.
- LDR into bruisers and tanks wo build some amount of armor and or HP 

# 3rd Item 

Duskblade - BOTRK - Last Whisper is a rather strong 3 item powerspike into a wide variety of Champions, but it is particularly strong into full tanks.

- Against bruisers, Duskblade - Last Whisper - Kraken may be somewhat more optimal 
- Against ADCs (no armor / health) then Duskblade - Collector - LDR or Duskblade - LDR - BT may be better.

# 4th Item
Here the build starts to get tricky. I would build things like Maw into AP, GA into assasins, Wits End into thornmail and so on.

{{< tab "Rageblade" >}} 
# Rageblade Build
**Counters high HP champions** (Aurelion Sol, Sion, Mundo, Chogath...)

**Do NOT use into Low HP champions**

The main case against Rageblade is that against low HP champions, a Duskblade/Yoummus build simultaneously achieves a similar kill time (with autos) and higher damage with ult. 

However, against even moderately **high HP** opponents like Aurelion Sol, Rageblade's dps can achieve kill times HALF of any lethality mythic. This is a faster kill time against tanks than MF has ever been able to achieve since her S6 rework.

# Core Items

![](/item/6676.png)![](/item/3153.png)![](/item/3124.png) + ![](/item/3036.png) or ![](/item/3033.png)

The item build order here is suggested. Against a full tank (Sion Data) the data shows that 
(BOTRK -> LDR -> Rageblade) is the optimal path. On the other hand, against Aurelion Sol (Collector -> BOTRK -> Rageblade) appears to be better. Either way, the objective is to hit a **4 item powerspike** Unfortunately this build is not pareto optimal against ADCs (see Jinx Data) until 3 items. Its simply a late game build.

# 5th Item
Since the 6th item has to be a zeal item (unless RIOT gifts us a better movement speed legendary) the build only has one flex item 

![](/item/6696.png) When in doubt make this. Considerably increases ult damage.

![](/item/3156.png) vs AP Burst 

![](/item/3026.png) vs AD Assasins 

![](/item/3091.png) Thornmail counter. DPS is almost comparable to Kraken 

![](/item/6672.png) For even more anti tank power




# 6th Item
![](/item/3046.png)![](/item/3094.png)![](/item/3085.png)

Make any movement speed item, sadly they they all suck compared to when Yoummus was a legendary

# 7st Item
Collector was is chosen as the 1st item for its early to mid game power. However in the ultra late game, there are better choices

![](/item/7008.png) vs AD Assasins in combination with GA

![](/item/3091.png) vs AP Burst in combination with Maw

![](/item/6696.png) Sacrifices ult power for more ult cdr

{{< tab "Runes" >}} 
# Runes: PTA - Cut Down - Gathering Storm
The main damage runs to consider for ultimate damage are Cut Down, Gathering Storm and First Strike.

While First Strike and Gathering storm can have stronger ult damage into squishies, into tanky champions Cut Down + Gathering Storm is stronger into tanks! On top of this, PTA has the strongest non-ultimate damage potential. Therefore, since I run into tanky enemy champions almost every game, these are my default runes

![](/Styles/Precision/PressTheAttack/PressTheAttack.png)
![](/Styles/Precision/Overheal.png)
![](/Styles/Precision/LegendAlacrity/LegendAlacrity.png)

![](/StatMods/StatModsAdaptiveForceIcon.png)
![](/StatMods/StatModsAdaptiveForceIcon.png)
![](/StatMods/StatModsHealthScalingIcon.png)
<!-- ![](/StatMods/StatModsAttackSpeedIcon.png) -->

- Use Manaflow Band over Absolute Focus if you cannot deal with mana control. 
    - Personally I get triggered every time an enemy walks away with 1HP when I run Manaflow Band, so every time I switch to manaflow I end up switching back eventually.
- Use Coup de Grace if no enemies have 10% more HP than MF.
- You can use whatever Stat Mods you want (attack speed, adaptive force, armor, health). 
	- Scaling health is better late game rune, because into lethality stacking champions, the armor shard does nothing. Early game, the armor Stat Mod is better.
	- adaptive force is better for poke (Q2) and ult damage.

{{< tab "Starting Items" >}} 
# Starting Items
![](/item/1055.png)![](/item/2003.png)

These are the default starting items, the health on Dorans is very valuable for early game all-in situations.

![](/item/1036.png)![](/item/2003.png)![](/item/2003.png)![](/item/2003.png)

The alternate starting items into poke lanes. 3 Pots buys us more time in lane to rush out Vamp Scepter and Refillable on first back

![](/item/1053.png)![](/item/1083.png)![](/item/1001.png)

I aim to build these items almost every game, you have to learn when to pick each one up based on experience. Boots can be skipped when building Yoummus.
{{< /tab >}}


{{< tab "Support Champions" >}} 
# Support Champions
The support makes or breaks botlane. This build **must** be played with a suitable supports.

## Suitable Supports:
- Hook Supports: Blitzcrank, Thresh, Nautilus, Pyke
	- MF has trouble dashing into an engage far away. Hook supports solve this problem by bringing the fight to us. 
- Poke + Engage Supports: Ashe, Lux
	- long stuns / roots that go through minions. The CC sets up MF's ultimate. 
- AOE Engage Supports: Ammumu, Neeko, Galio, Rell
	- Survive lane and get 5 man ults

## Unsuitable Supports: use comet or different adc.
- No on demand engage:
	- Soraka, Brand, Veigar,
- MF cannot take advantage of these "delayed CC" champions well.
	- Yuumi, Senna, Karma

## Discussion on other Mythics

From the simulation data it is clear that there are only three competive mythics. 

Rageblade has the best dps into tanky champions, primarily because it amplifies BOTRK damage. we are talking killing a late game sion in just 2.5s compared to 3.36s without it. However, it also has many problems...
- Ultimate damage is poor, because Rageblade prevents Ult from critting. We can improve ult damage but this can be somewhat addressed by shoring up ultimate damage with Collector and Axiom Arc
