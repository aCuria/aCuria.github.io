# Comet

To me the comet playstyle is a saving grace type build when Miss Fortune is Counterpicked. We sacrifice duelling power for long ranged poke damage. 

One recent game was when I locked in MF + Lux and was counterpicked by Draven. Comet got me out of laning phase with a small advantage, and this was enough to win the game as Draven falls off late game.

In general Comet tends to be better into immobile ADCs who cannot dash out of E range and the Comet proc. 

In the late game, Comet will never be as good as PTA because we lose an entire 12% damage amplification on PTA, and Manaflow band is not a good trade for the 300 Overheal shield.

I computed everything in the build assuming bloodline + cut down, but the runes are ultimately situational.

- Alacrity is better for killing as fast as possible, but early game it may delay Kraken by 900g if we need an early Scepter
- Attack speed shard over Adaptive Force is fine, but personally I like Q2 to do more damage early game.
- Coup de Grace over Cut Down is fine if there are no tanks
- Overheal + Bloodline is probably better into burst damage 
- If there are no tanks, Eyeball Collector + Treasure Hunter kills faster mid game (full stacks), but it is obviously worse early game (0 stacks) and worse late game than alacrity + coup or alacrity + cut down.

## **Overheal**
![](/Styles/Precision/Overheal.png)

Overheal is probably better than bloodline late game, as long as the build has some lifesteal in it. However, early game it delays our build by 900g because we have to build that Early Scepter. I was busy comparing bloodline to alacrity and forgot all about overheal... If i ever re-do this page I would run overheal as default.

While Yoummus kills slower, it is compensated by an earlier powerspike, more CDR and more ult damage.

In a 1v1 duel, the Bloodthirster build should be the best since it has the highest AdHp / tk metric

## Draven 
The difference between Draven and Jinx, is that Draven builds Shieldbow. In a 1v1 duel, the Bloodthirster build should be the best since it has the highest AdHp / tk metric

## Vex

Into Vex and other burst mages, we mainly care about not dying to ap Burst (ApB). Its better to run Bloodline over alacrity here for more HP. 

You have to figure out how early to build Hexdrinker depending on how fed the enemy assasins are.

Note that for ap dps type enemy champions, such as Kayle and Cassiopea, this approach does not work. We have to make straight damage into them.

## Rengar

Into Rengar Vex and other ad assasins, we mainly care about not dying to ad Burst (AdB). Its better to run Bloodline over alacrity here for more HP. 

You have to figure out how early to build GA items depending on how fed the enemy assasins are.

Note that for ad dps type enemy champions, such as Master Yi and Nocturne, this approach does not work. We have to make straight damage into them.

## Riven 
Riven is the kind of champion that needs to be deleted as quickly as possible while she is cced by our team, with either aa's or ult. Therefore we try to maximize tk or ult.

## Mordekaiser using Anathema's Chains
Usually I assume Prowler's active is never used, but I think prowlers is actually fairly safe to use inside of Mordekaiser ult. We can even use it to dodge a spell. Prowler's should be bought as a 7th item here.

I am trying to maximize (ApHp / tk), which is the Effective HP into AP damage per unit time taken to kill. This is because the longer we take to kill, the more incomming damage we can expect to take inside of Mordekaier's ultimate.

## Sion

Items are in order of damage into sion, but **we have to build to win bot lane, then transition into anti tank to win teamfights**.
I would usually build Kraken Yoummus LDR BOTRK, or Kraken boots1 BOTRK LDR to get the anti tank core items out faster.
