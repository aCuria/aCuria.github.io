# PTA Guide (Updated Patch 13.16)

## Item Build
I am going to keep it simple. For more details consult the Simulation Data section

## Runes: PTA - Cut Down - Gathering Storm
The main damage runs to consider for ultimate damage are Cut Down, Gathering Storm and First Strike.

While First Strike and Gathering storm can have stronger ult damage into squishies, into tanky champions Cut Down + Gathering Storm is stronger into tanks! On top of this, PTA has the strongest non-ultimate damage potential. Therefore, since I run into tanky enemy champions almost every game, these are my default runes

- Use Manaflow Band over Absolute Focus if you cannot deal with mana control. Personally I get triggered every time an enemy walks away with 1HP when I run Manaflow Band.
- Use Coup de Grace if no enemies have 10% more HP than MF.
- You can use whatever Stat Mods you want (attack speed, adaptive force, armor, health). 
	- Scaling health is better late game rune, because into lethality stacking champions, the armor shard does nothing. Early game, the armor Stat Mod is better.
	- adaptive force is better for poke (Q2) and ult damage.


## Supports
The support makes or breaks botlane. This build **must** be played with a suitable supports.

### Suitable Supports:
- Hook Supports: Blitzcrank, Thresh, Nautilus, Pyke
	- MF has trouble dashing into an engage far away. Hook supports solve this problem by bringing the fight to us. 
- Poke + Engage Supports: Ashe, Lux
	- long stuns / roots that go through minions. The CC sets up MF's ultimate. 
- AOE Engage Supports: Ammumu, Neeko, Galio, Rell
	- Survive lane and get 5 man ults

### Unsuitable Supports: use comet or different adc.
- No on demand engage:
	- Soraka, Brand, Veigar,
- MF cannot take advantage of these delayed engage champions well.
	- Yuumi, Senna, Karma
