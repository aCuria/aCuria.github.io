# Lord Domnik's Regards vs Infinity Edge at Item 3

Consider a squishy like Pyke, who has 102 armor at L13 including the minor rune. We actually need >80% crit for IE's passive to exceed the value of 30% armor pen.

Armor|% damage increase from 30% pen
-|-
100|17.6%
125|20%
150|22%
200|25%
300|29%

Crit Chance|% damage increase from IE's 35% bonus critical strike damage
-|-
20%|	6.1%
40%|	10.8%
60%|	14.5%
80%|	17.5%
100%|	20%

% damage increase at 3 item from ad difference less gold difference (70 - 35 - 14.2) = 20.8ad more. 20.8 / 288.68 = 7% (the % goes down with more items)

% damage increase from giant slayer = 1% per 100 hp Pauldrons of Whiterock = 250hp, base hp difference = 41, total 218 hp = 2.81% damage increase

So overall the best case for IE = + 1.145 * 1.07 = 1.22% damage increase from ad and crit damage

And for LDR we have 20% from 30% pen alone, total 1.2 * 1.0281 = 23.3% damage increase

Lets not forget that LDR boosts ultimate damage by the full 23.3% too.

And this is a bad scenario for LDR. In the best case we are talking +61% damage at 300 armor and +2500hp difference.

## IE Stats
- +70 attack damage
- +20 crit
- +35 crit damage
- costs +400g more (=14.2ad)

## LDR Stats
- 35AD
- 20% crit (= +15% aa damage, 22% with IE)
- 37.5 flat pen (could be way more vs tanks)
- +1% damage per 100hp difference capped at +25% damage
