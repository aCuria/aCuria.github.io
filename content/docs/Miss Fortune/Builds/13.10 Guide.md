# This entire page is work in progress due to the massive changes in 13.10.
I am going to try to explain "how to fish" aka "how to come up with what build to use yourself"

# What is the best build?
There is no true "Best" Build for all games. The "Best" build is a situational one depending on the win condition of that particular game. For example:

## Win Condition: Not dying to the fed assasin = win game 

Build high Effective HP against Burst. Bloodline tends to be somewhat better at this metric
- [PTA Alacrity Rengar TK_ADEHP_BURST]({{< ref "RawData/PTA Alacrity/Rengar TK_ADEHP_BURST" >}})
- [PTA Alacrity Vex TK_APEHP_BURST]({{< ref "RawData/PTA Alacrity/Vex TK_APEHP_BURST" >}})
- [PTA Bloodline Rengar TK_ADEHP_BURST]({{< ref "RawData/PTA Alacrity/Rengar TK_ADEHP_BURST" >}})
- [PTA Bloodline Vex TK_APEHP_BURST]({{< ref "RawData/PTA Alacrity/Vex TK_APEHP_BURST" >}})

## Win Condition: Taking down the fed Riven / Insert Bruiser Here = win game 

If the bruiser touches us, we are supposed to die. Therefore use a glass cannon build that kills in a minimum amount of time, so that the bruiser has the smallest possible window to kill us.
Preferably we are able to 100-0 the Bruiser within the CC duration of our support

- [PTA Alacrity Riven TKILL]({{< ref "RawData/PTA Alacrity/Riven TKILL" >}})
- [PTA Bloodline Riven TKILL]({{< ref "RawData/PTA Bloodline/Riven TKILL" >}})

## Win Condition: Successfully Duel dps champions = win game 

In the late game, use builds with a fast kill time to effective HP ratio 
- [PTA Alacrity Jinx TK_ADEHP_D_TK]({{< ref "RawData/PTA Alacrity/Jinx TK_ADEHP_D_TK" >}})
- [PTA Alacrity Draven TK_ADEHP_D_TK]({{< ref "RawData/PTA Alacrity/Draven TK_ADEHP_D_TK" >}})
- [PTA Alacrity AurelionSol TK_APEHP_D_TK]({{< ref "RawData/PTA Alacrity/AurelionSol TK_APEHP_D_TK" >}})
- [PTA Bloodline Jinx TK_ADEHP_D_TK]({{< ref "RawData/PTA Bloodline/Jinx TK_ADEHP_D_TK" >}})
- [PTA Bloodline Draven TK_ADEHP_D_TK]({{< ref "RawData/PTA Bloodline/Draven TK_ADEHP_D_TK" >}})
- [PTA Bloodline AurelionSol TK_APEHP_D_TK]({{< ref "RawData/PTA Bloodline/AurelionSol TK_APEHP_D_TK" >}})

## Win Condition: Taking down the fed tank = win game 

Use an anti tank build. We dont want to get killed by the tank either, so effective HP against the tank's damage type is important
- [PTA Alacrity Chogath TK_APEHP]({{< ref "RawData/PTA Alacrity/Chogath TK_APEHP" >}})

## Win Condition: Surviving Lane = win game 
This happens when facing an enemy ADC who has a strong early game and weak late game. One example would be Draven

Usually some variant comet build is best for this, expecially into immobile champions who do not have a dash to avoid E and comet damage.

- [Comet Draven TK_ULT]({{< ref "RawData/Comet CutDown/Draven TK_ULT" >}})

That said I really do not like playing comet because it does not scale well. 

I would skew towards builds with more ultimate damage, because ultimate damage is not affected by running comet runes 


# What are the best early game items?
Personally I would determine what my desired endgame build is first (see win conditions), then figure out which items in that build are also strong into the enemy ADC at 1 item.

- [PTA Alacrity Jinx TK_ULT]({{< ref "RawData/PTA Alacrity/Jinx TK_ULT" >}})
- [PTA Alacrity Draven TK_ULT]({{< ref "RawData/PTA Alacrity/Draven TK_ULT" >}})
- [PTA Bloodline Jinx TK_ULT]({{< ref "RawData/PTA Bloodline/Jinx TK_ULT" >}})
- [PTA Bloodline Draven TK_ULT]({{< ref "RawData/PTA Bloodline/Draven TK_ULT" >}})



# Q & A

## Why are there extra item components in the raw data?
I am trying to normalize the gold cost of different builds by "buying" additional item components with "extra gold". This has the side effect of giving a value to free item slots and rune choices 

Every item build is credited with:
- +900g (Vamp Scepter): If a build already has lifesteal, the 900g can be spent on ad components 
- +300g (Boots1): If a build already another source of movement speed, the 300g can be spent on ad components  
- +180g If Dorans Blade has been "sold", 180g is credited 

## How to read the raw data?

- **tk**: Time taken for Miss Fortune to kill this particular from full HP
- **ult**: Ultimate Damage done by Miss Fortune into this particular champion, starting from full HP
- **aaqaa**: Damage dealt after the second auto (aa + q + aa). If this value is blank, it may mean that the champion was killed with aa + q, in which case I did not record the aa + q + aa damage.
- **AdHp**: Miss Fortune's Effective HP against AD damage against the enemy champion. This is affected by how much armor pen the enemy champion is assumed to have bought in his build
- **AdHp/Tk**: Effective HP against AD damage divided by Time taken to kill. I am trying to express the idea that the longer we take to kill an enemy champion, the more damage we can expect to take from that enemy champion.
- **AdB**: Effective HP against AD *burst* damage. This does not account for healing, since we cannot heal through damage that kills us instantly
- **g**: Cost of the build in Gold

## What items does the algo overestimate?
Items with long cooldown active abilities. 

For example:
- Galeforce active damage is accounted for in the computation, but in a real game Galeforce may be on cooldown!
- Guardian Angel is assumed to be off cooldown for the purposes of the 50% base HP restore passive
- Shieldbow's Shield is assumed to be off cooldown
- Maw's Shield is assumed to be off cooldown
- Yoummu's bonus Lethality is assumed to fully charged (this is a more reasonable assumption given how fast it charges)

## What items does the algo underestimate?
Utility items. It is very difficult to put a gold value to utility items

For example:
- QSS's CC removal
- Duskblade's untargetable passive
- Edge of Night's spellshield
- Guardian Angel's revive passive (the 4s revive timer utility)
- Tenacity items



# PTA Bloodline

## Main advantage 
- Bloodline gives us what I call "Build acceleration". Into normal lanes, we can sustain well with bloodline + dorans, which allows us to quickly hit item powerspikes. With Alacrity, it is very common to have to sink 900g into Vamp Scepter.
- Late game, Bloodline is better into burst damage because of that extra 100 health.
- Bloodline tends to score well on the AdHp/Tk 1v1 metric 

## Sample Gameplay


## Supports
The support makes or breaks botlane. This build **must** be played with a suitable supports.

### Suitable Supports:
- Hook Supports: Blitzcrank, Thresh, Nautilus, Pyke
	- MF has trouble dashing into an engage far away. Hook supports solve this problem by bringing the fight to us. 
- Poke + Engage Supports: Ashe, Lux
	- long stuns / roots that go through minions
- AOE Engage Supports: Ammumu, Neeko, Galio, Rell
	- Survive lane and get 5 man ults

### Unsuitable Supports: use comet or different adc.
- No on demand engage:
	- Soraka, Brand, Veigar,
- Engages too far away
	- Yuumi, Senna,  


## Runes
![](/Styles/Precision/PressTheAttack/PressTheAttack.png)
![](/Styles/Precision/Overheal.png)
![](/Styles/Precision/LegendBloodline/LegendBloodline.png)
![](/Styles/Precision/CutDown/CutDown.png)

![](/StatMods/StatModsAdaptiveForceIcon.png)
![](/StatMods/StatModsHealthScalingIcon.png)
<!-- ![](/StatMods/StatModsAttackSpeedIcon.png) -->

I computed everything in the build assuming these runes.
- Use Manaflow Band over AbsoluteFocus if you can't conserve mana use
- Use Coup de Grace if there are no enemies with more than 10% more HP than you.
- You can use whatever Stat Mods you want (attack speed, adaptive force, armor, health). 
	- Scaling health is better late game rune, because into lethality stacking champions, the armor shard does nothing. Early game, the armor Stat Mod is better.
	- adaptive force is better for poke (Q2) and ult damage.

## How to use the results below
- I force either boots1 or a movement speed item to be bought. 
- Builds with a movement speed item have an extra 300g to spend on ad components 
- Note that I currently assume that Yoummu's extra lethality is only active for the entirety of ult and then first 0.1s of combat.

## Glossary 

- Build: Items purchased
- g: Build cost in gold 
- tk: Time taken to kill in seconds
- ult: Bullet Time damage
- aaqaa: Damage dealt by aa q aa into a full HP enemy
- AdHp: Effective HP against AD damage, considers self healing and enemy armor pen
- ApHp: Effective HP against AP damage, considers self healing and enemy magic pen
- adB: Effective HP against AD burst damage, considers enemy armor pen
- apB: Effective HP against AP burst damage, considers enemy magic pen



# Item 1
- The Item 1 builds were computed against Jinx's (the adc's) stats 
- Galeforce is mainly good when the active is off cooldown, and you hit someone under 25% HP for bonus damage



# Full Builds

I have no idea whats best for 13.10 yet, but here is some data



## Jinx

I use Jinx's stats to represent all the ADCs who are not building shieldbow

This specific build hits some breakpoint and kills Jinx with just aa > q 


### Sorted by increasing ult damage 


### Sorted by increasing AdHp/Tk


### Builds that enable aa > q = Kill breakpoint 



## Zac (Anti Tank) 


### Ult Damage Build?



## Draven

I use Draven's stats to represent all the ADCs who build shieldbow

note: **dorans shield = statikk shiv** until riot updates their api and i pull the new images






## Aurelion Sol 

DPS Mage 


## Vex
I use Vex's stats to represent all the Burst Mages. (Not Kayle, Cass who are sustained damage mages)



## Rengar
I use Rengar's stats to represent all the AD Burst assasins. (Not Nocturne / Yi who will auto attack forever)

I forced the algo to use GA, no idea why nashors sometimes pops up, you have to figure out the order to build the items yourself.




## Riven 

Fastest Kill Time Build 


## Sylas


## Zac
1v1 Build (Best AdHp/Tk) 


## Chogath

## Ksante (Tank Form)
1v1 Build (Best AdHp/Tk) 

## Sion



## Vayne with Randuin's Omen 
Randuins Omen Vayne gets his own section because he can be annoying. I **think** making high AdHp/Tk does not work into vayne's true damage, so my guess is that fastest kill time is best.



## Mordekaiser using Anathema's Chains
1v1 Build (Best AdHp/Tk)
