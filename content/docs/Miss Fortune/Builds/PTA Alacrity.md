# PTA Alacrity (Work in Progress)

Alacrity is better into those champions where you have to kill them **as fast as possible**. 
After our team engages, we only have a small window of 1-2s to secure the kill.

# Jinx
I use Jinx's stats to represent all ADCs who do not build shieldbow.

Recently I updated the analytics engine to spit out this "AdHp/Tk" stat, which is total effective HP, considering the enemy armor pen, self shields and heal divided by time taken to kill. I think this stat is key to identifying the "best" build in a 1v1 scenario into dps champions, because we should be ok to drag out the fight some if it means it is harder for the enemy to kill us.
