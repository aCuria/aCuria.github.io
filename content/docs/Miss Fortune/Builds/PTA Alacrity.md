# PTA Alacrity

# Jinx
I use Jinx's stats to represent all ADCs who do not build shieldbow.

Recently I updated the analytics engine to spit out this "AdHp/Tk" stat, which is total effective HP, considering the enemy armor pen, self shields and heal divided by time taken to kill. I think this stat is key to identifying the "best" build in a 1v1 scenario into dps champions, because we should be ok to drag out the fight some if it means it is harder for the enemy to kill us.

Build | tk | ult | AdHp | AdHp/Tk | AdB
