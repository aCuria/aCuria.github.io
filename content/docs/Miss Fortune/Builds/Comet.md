# Comet

To me the comet playstyle is a saving grace type build when Miss Fortune is Counterpicked. We sacrifice duelling power for long ranged poke damage. 

One recent game was when I locked in MF + Lux and was counterpicked by Draven. Comet got me out of laning phase with a small advantage, and this was enough to win the game as Draven falls off late game.

In general Comet tends to be better into immobile ADCs who cannot dash out of E range and the Comet proc.
