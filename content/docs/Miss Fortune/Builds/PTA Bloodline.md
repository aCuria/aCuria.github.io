# PTA Bloodline

## Main advantage 
- Bloodline gives us what I call "Build acceleration". Into normal lanes, we can sustain well with bloodline + dorans, which allows us to quickly hit item powerspikes. With Alacrity, it is very common to have to sink 900g into Vamp Scepter.
- Late game, Bloodline is better into burst damage because of that extra 100 health.
- Bloodline tends to score well on the AdHp/Tk 1v1 metric 

## Sample Gameplay

## Supports
The support makes or breaks botlane. This build **must** be played with a suitable supports.

### Suitable Supports:
- Hook Supports: Blitzcrank, Thresh, Nautilus, Pyke
	- MF has trouble dashing into an engage far away. Hook supports solve this problem by bringing the fight to us. 
- Poke + Engage Supports: Ashe, Lux
	- long stuns / roots that go through minions
- AOE Engage Supports: Ammumu, Neeko, Galio, Rell
	- Survive lane and get 5 man ults

### Unsuitable Supports: use comet or different adc.
- No on demand engage:
	- Soraka, Brand, Veigar,
- Engages too far away
	- Yuumi, Senna,

<!-- ![](/StatMods/StatModsAttackSpeedIcon.png) -->

I computed everything in the build assuming these runes.
- Use Manaflow Band over AbsoluteFocus if you can't conserve mana use
- Use Coup de Grace if there are no enemies with more than 10% more HP than you.
- You can use whatever Stat Mods you want (attack speed, adaptive force, armor, health). 
	- Scaling health is better late game rune, because into lethality stacking champions, the armor shard does nothing. Early game, the armor Stat Mod is better.
	- adaptive force is better for poke (Q2) and ult damage.

## How to use the results below
- If Yoummus or some other out of combat movement speed item is not bought as a second item, then buy at least boots1. In playtesting I have been buying Yoummu's second when I am ahead (better chase power and ult damage), but when behind it may be a bad idea
- The Berzerker's Greaves upgrade is primarily for more movement speed. The damage can be good if we want the movement speed anyway, but if we dont want the movement speed then the damage is usually not good vs buying more AD.
- You can experiment with changing the build order
- You should choose the build based on your win condition (kill x champion, survive burst, ...) 
- In general I figure out the strongest 6 item build, then work backwards to find the best build path

## Hybrid Builds
I find myself buying something like this very often, when there are hybrid threats. (BOTRK + LDR) is good into any tank matchup, Maw counters burst mages and BT is good into dps champions.

## Ult Damage
If you want to transition late game into ult damage, then make this. It is the same into all matchups. The ult damage indicated is into Zac.

## Vex
I use Vex's stats to represent all the Burst Mages. (Not Kayle, Cass who are sustained damage mages)

- BOTRK build included, because into a tank threat we really want BOTRK 
- Prowlers at 7th item seems like an upgrade in defence against burst, but its more of a for fun thing. we probably dont need it.

## Riven 

The fastest kill time build actually uses navori, and relies on getting a 2nd Q to kill faster. This is the 2nd fastest kill time, but when we approach a bruiser we dont do so alone... someone has to cc them first. For this reason in real games getting a 2nd Q probably will not happen at all.

## Sylas
There is a prowlers build that looks good, so I included it. Prowlers must be built as a 7th item replacing Kraken, since prowlers is not good early game.
I assume the prowlers active is never used.

## Sion

Rageblade is the kind of item that kills tanks faster, but our ult damage also goes to shit at the same time... Therefore there needs to be a non Rageblade option.

The odd thing is that prowlers seems decent here as a 7th item ultra late game.... I suppose sion does not build that much armor (Heartsteel Titanic). It is probably possible to use prowler's active to dodge his Q too. We rely on the 25 ms from prowlers here instead of yoummus.

## Vayne with Randuin's Omen 
Randuins Omen Vayne gets his own section because he can be annoying. I **think** making high AdHp/Tk does not work into vayne's true damage, so my guess is that fastest kill time is best.
