I am in the middle of re-writing the below in markdown

## Runes

![](/StatMods/StatModsHealthScalingIcon.png)
<!-- ![](/StatMods/StatModsAttackSpeedIcon.png) -->

I computed everything in the build assuming these runes.
- Use Manaflow Band over AbsoluteFocus if you can't conserve mana use
- Use Coup de Grace if there are no enemies with more than 10% more HP than you.
- You can use whatever Stat Mods you want (attack speed, adaptive force, armor, health). 
	- Scaling health is better late game rune, because into lethality stacking champions, the armor shard does nothing. Early game, the armor Stat Mod is better.
	- adaptive force is better for poke (Q2) and ult damage.

## How to use the results below
- If Yoummus or some other out of combat movement speed item is not bought as a second item, then buy boots1 at 2nd item. In playtesting I have been buying Yoummu's second when I am ahead (better chase), but when behind it may be a bad idea
- The Berzerker's Greaves upgrade is primarily for more movement speed. The damage can be good if we want the movement speed anyway, but if we dont want the movement speed then the damage is usually not good vs buying more AD.
- You can experiment with changing the build order
- You should choose the build based on your win condition (kill x champion, survive burst, ...) 
- In general I figure out the strongest 6 item build, then work backwards to find the best build path


## Ult Damage
If you want to transition late game into ult damage, then make this. It is the same into all matchups. The ult damage indicated is into Zac.

## Jinx

I use Jinx's stats to represent all the ADCs who are not building shieldbow

## Vex
I use Vex's stats to represent all the Burst Mages. (Not Kayle, Cass who are sustained damage mages)

- BOTRK build included, because into a tank threat we really want BOTRK 
- Prowlers at 7th item seems like an upgrade in defence against burst, but we probably dont need it.

## Rengar
I use Rengar's stats to represent all the AD Burst assasins. (Not Nocturne / Yi who will auto attack forever)

## Riven 

The fastest kill time build actually uses navori, and relies on getting a 2nd Q to kill faster. This is the 2nd fastest kill time, but when we approach a bruiser we dont do so alone... someone has to cc them first. For this reason in real games getting a 2nd Q probably will not happen at all.

## Sylas
There is a prowlers build that looks good, so I included it. Prowlers must be built as a 7th item replacing Kraken, since prowlers is not good early game.
I assume the prowlers active is never used.

## Sion

Rageblade is the kind of item that kills tanks faster, but our ult damage also goes to shit at the same time... Therefore there needs to be a non Rageblade option.

The odd thing is that prowlers seems decent here as a 7th item ultra late game.... I suppose sion does not build that much armor (Heartsteel Titanic). It is probably possible to use prowler's active to dodge his Q too. We rely on the 25 ms from prowlers here instead of yoummus.

## Vayne with Randuin's Omen 
Randuins Omen Vayne gets his own section because he can be annoying. I **think** making high AdHp/Tk does not work into vayne's true damage, so my guess is that fastest kill time is best.
