# Teamfights

## 2v2 Teamfights
In a 2v2 fight, you should attempt to do the following:

1) Use E to slow
2) Land the aa > q > aa combo
3) Use R when they are out of aa range.

A common mistake is to use R straight away, this is not always the correct response if you can get into AA range fast enough. Miss Fortune has huge burst on her AA Q AA combo, without crit it is worth 300% ad + 100 + PTA + Kraken, and possibly 400% if Q bounces. PTA also increases your ultimate damage.

Notice we were losing badly in the above clip, having fed 7 kills. In spite of this we could pick up the double kill

In this clip I was fed enough to one-shot Jhin with aa > q > aa

## 5v5 Teamfights
The main idea is to find a way to channel a good ult right at the start of a teamfight. If you can cast aa > q > aa before ult its even better, but most of the time this is not safe impossible.

In this clip, the enemy team had wasted their engage and terrain prevented them from getting out of MF Ult.

In this clip, my ult was set up by Seraphine's CC. It is extremely important for MF to have a support (and preferably jungle as well) who can setup Ult like this.
