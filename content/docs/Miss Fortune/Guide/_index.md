# Guide Introduction
I first played Miss Fortune in Season 2, and mained her more seriously after her 2016 rework. Miss Fortune plays and itemizes differently from other ADCs, and I hope this guide will help you enjoy Miss Fortune as much as I do. The guide is intended for new players who want learn how to play Miss Fortune better mechanicslly.

# Why Play Miss Fortune?

{{< columns >}}

## Pros
- One of the easiest ADC to CS with, because the Love Tap Passive means 1.25x - 1.5x ad damage to minions!
- Miss Fortune is a teamfighting monster, a well placed Bullet Time can win a game on its own
- Multiple playstyles due to huge build and rune diversity
- Strong late game dueling power, able to one shot any squishies in 0.45s with aa q aa
- Destroys towers very quickly
- High +95 movement speed due to strut
- Can build more AD items then other ADCs, while still hitting the 2.5 attack speed cap due to the free attack speed on strut
- Stronger user of lifesteal because her Passive, Q and W synergizes with lifesteal

## Cons
- Short 550 auto attack range
- Base kit very weak into tanks. She must rely on accurate runes and item builds to circumvent this weakness
- Mana hungry. She cannot spam abilities without some mana regeneration in her build, and building mana means losing damage.
- No good escapes (dash/stun/root)
- A large part of her power buidget (Bullet Time) can be circumvented by basic abilities (wind wall)
- Weak early game dueling power because if she does not have the items to kill in under 4s, her W times out.
